A python helper for formatting KML files containing coordinates into CSV files. Please refer to https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/34159/how-to-convert-google-map-route-into-array-of-coordinates for the procedure of getting the KML files.

A quick guide for using the script:
  1. Please check your python environment before running the script
  2. Put the KML files in the same folder with the script
  3. Run the script anyway you prefer (command prompt, IDE...). Note that you do not need to add ".kml" when inputting file name
  4. Follow the onscreen instructions and you will get a csv file with the same name of your kml file in the folder
  
Notes:
  1. If the destination csv file is opened, the script cannot edit it
  2. Error checking is none-existing. Be careful with the script...
  3. Team members feel free to report bugs and add some new features
